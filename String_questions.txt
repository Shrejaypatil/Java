Here’s a list of string manipulation questions commonly asked in technical coding interviews, categorized from easy to hard:

Easy:
Reverse a String
Given a string, return the reversed version of it.
Check for Palindrome
Determine if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
Count Vowels and Consonants
Write a function that counts the number of vowels and consonants in a string.
Find the First Non-Repeating Character
Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it.
Implement strstr()
Find the index of the first occurrence of a substring within another string, or return -1 if not found.


Medium:
Longest Common Prefix

Given an array of strings, find the longest common prefix string amongst them.
Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
String Compression

Implement a method to compress strings by counting consecutive characters. For example, aabcccccaaa becomes a2b1c5a3.
Remove Duplicates from a String

Remove all duplicate characters in a string and return the result.
Check for Anagram

Write a function to determine if two strings are anagrams of each other.




Hard:
Longest Palindromic Substring

Given a string, find the longest substring that is a palindrome.
Wildcard Pattern Matching

Implement wildcard pattern matching with support for ? and * where ? matches a single character and * matches any sequence of characters.
Edit Distance (Levenshtein Distance)

Given two strings, find the minimum number of operations (insert, delete, or replace) required to convert one string into the other.
Word Break Problem

Given a string and a dictionary of words, determine if the string can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of dictionary words.
Regular Expression Matching

Implement regular expression matching with support for . and *. . matches any single character, and * matches zero or more of the preceding element.
