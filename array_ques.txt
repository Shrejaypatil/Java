Here are some common array manipulation questions that you might encounter in technical coding interviews:

Easy
Find the maximum and minimum elements in an array

Given an array of integers, find the maximum and minimum elements.
Move all zeros to the end

Given an array of integers, move all the zeros to the end while maintaining the order of the other elements.
Reverse an array

Reverse the elements of an array in place.
Remove duplicates from sorted array

Given a sorted array, remove duplicates in-place and return the new length.
Rotate an array

Rotate the array by k steps to the right (cyclically).


Medium
Find the subarray with the maximum sum (Kadane's Algorithm)

Given an array of integers, find the contiguous subarray that has the largest sum.
Find all pairs in an array whose sum is equal to a given value

Given an array of integers, find all unique pairs whose sum equals a target value.
Find the missing number in a range

An array contains n distinct numbers in the range [0, n]. One number is missing, find the missing number.
Merge two sorted arrays

Given two sorted arrays, merge them into one sorted array.
Longest consecutive subsequence

Find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence in an unsorted array.
