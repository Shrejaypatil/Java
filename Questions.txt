Here are some similar system design and logic-based questions for practice:

1. Discount Strategy for Online Retailer
Question: Design a system that displays discount offers for customers of an online retail platform. The offers should include percentage discounts, fixed amount discounts, and buy-one-get-one-free offers. The system should ensure that:
Certain discounts apply only if the total cart value exceeds a minimum threshold.
Users can combine a maximum of two offers.
VIP customers can stack additional discounts on top of existing offers.
Objective: Build a logic that applies and sorts the most beneficial offers for the customer.
Hint: Use similar logic for calculating discounts, but ensure that combining offers works under the constraints.


2. Flight Booking Platform Offers
Question: You are tasked with building a system for sorting offers on a flight booking platform. The offers include:
Cashback on credit card payments.
Discounts for users booking tickets for more than 3 passengers.
Special discounts for users booking more than 15 days in advance.
Loyalty points for frequent flyers.
Requirements:
The system should prioritize offers based on their savings.
Customers should receive only the highest-priority offer unless they are frequent flyers, in which case they get loyalty points as well.
Objective: Write logic to handle offer sorting based on these requirements.


3. Dynamic Meal Plan Discount Logic for Food Delivery
Question: Design a discount logic for a food delivery service that offers:
Discounts for ordering from selected restaurants.
A flat discount for subscribing to a monthly meal plan.
Special discounts for bulk orders (orders above Rs. 1000).
Free drinks for premium users with orders above Rs. 500.
Requirements:
Ensure the meal plan discount is always the highest priority.
Regular users can combine only one offer, while premium users can stack offers.
Objective: Implement a system to rank and apply the most beneficial discount based on order details.


4. E-Commerce Loyalty Program Sorting
Question: An e-commerce platform has a loyalty program offering:
Discounts based on customer tier (Silver, Gold, Platinum).
Cashback for purchases above Rs. 2000.
Free shipping for purchases above Rs. 1000.
Special coupons for Gold and Platinum users.
Requirements:
If the cart value exceeds Rs. 2000, the customer should get both cashback and free shipping.
Gold and Platinum users should get additional exclusive offers.
Silver users can only avail one discount at a time.
Objective: Build a logic to apply and prioritize offers based on the user's loyalty tier and cart value.\


5. Multi-Category Discount Sorting for Supermarket
Question: Design a discount system for a supermarket checkout that handles:
Category-based discounts (e.g., 10% off on fruits).
Discounts for purchases of more than 5 items from the same category.
Combination of storewide discounts with category-specific discounts.
Membership-based extra discount on top of other offers.
Requirements:
Ensure only one category-specific discount can be combined with a storewide discount.
Members can stack a membership discount on top of other discounts.
Objective: Implement logic to apply the best combination of offers while respecting constraints.



6. Travel Booking Offers
Question: A travel booking website offers several deals:
5% discount for booking more than 7 days in advance.
Cashback for using specific payment methods.
Additional discounts for booking hotel + flight packages.
VIP users get a free hotel upgrade on top of any offer.
Requirements:
The system should apply the most rewarding offer unless the user is a VIP, in which case they receive the free upgrade in addition to other offers.
Only one discount can be applied for non-VIP users.
Objective: Write logic to implement this system.



7. Mobile Carrier Plans with Discounts
Question: Design a system for a mobile carrier's payment portal. The system should handle:
Discounts on prepaid recharge plans (e.g., 10% off on Rs. 500 plans).
Cashback for users recharging more than Rs. 1000.
A bonus data pack for postpaid users subscribing to an annual plan.
Special perks for users who opt for auto-renewal.
Requirements:
Postpaid users can combine the bonus data pack with other offers.
Prepaid users get only one offer at a time unless they opt for auto-renewal.
Objective: Create logic to decide and apply offers based on the plan type (prepaid/postpaid), recharge amount, and whether auto-renewal is selected.


8. Grocery Store Promotional Offers
Question: A grocery store offers several promotions:
10% off for orders above Rs. 1000.
Buy 2 get 1 free on specific products.
Free home delivery for orders above Rs. 1500.
Additional 5% off for premium members.
Requirements:
Premium members should be able to stack the 5% discount with other offers.
Non-premium members should only get one offer unless their cart value exceeds Rs. 1500, in which case they also get free delivery.
Objective: Implement the logic to handle this promotional offer system.
These practice questions cover various types of offers and discount strategies, similar to your Swiggy payment offers scenario, and help you design robust and flexible offer management systems.
